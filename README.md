# Inspiration
We were inspired by the already existing Reflectly and Daily.io apps, which target users to track the things that they did throughout the day as well as what made them happy, sad, frustrated, etc. However, we realized that these apps don't provide a place where you can set goals for yourself to expand your comfort zone and increase your productivity while providing these services at the same time, so we created Starling in order to accomplish that.

# What it does
Starling aims to help individuals step out of their comfort zones. We do this by asking for user input (their goals, how productive their day was, and what they are grateful for) and providing them with generated inspirational quotes looking to give them motivation and hope in order to make their days as productive as possible.

# How we built it
Our team used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to code the website and Canva to create designs, such as the logo. We split the coding job into sections and each worked on Qoom, and eventually integrated the sections together into one big project.

# Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we ran into included some formatting issues (e.g. trying to make sure that the website looks appealing on all devices) as well as some design issues (e.g. the graphics and the colours of the layout not fitting in with the rest of the site).

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we managed to build a decent website in a day and a half, despite most of us not knowing any HTML/CSS before the hackathon started. We are also proud of the fact that we were able to implement some of the more challenging aspects of our website, such as the user being able to upload a profile image and our quote/goal generator within a short amount of time.

# What we learned
We learned the basics of HTML/CSS and how front-end developers work in order to create both visually appealing and effective websites. We also learned some of the more complicated aspects of HTML/CSS, such as gathering user input and displaying randomized quotes and goals for the user.
